A dark-colored vest might be worn over this in colder weather.\n    * Simple straw sandals or leather boots depending on the situation.\n* **Accessories:**\n    * A dojang (Korean headwear often associated with scholars), though his would be slightly more weathered and worn. It can be adjusted to shadow his face.\n    * A jangdo (Korean sword) strapped to his hip.\n    * A small, intricately carved wooden pendant hanging from a leather cord around his neck.  This might be a family heirloom or a memento of a lost love.\n\n\n**Personality:**\n\n* **Cunning:** Dohyeong is a master strategist and manipulator, always thinking several steps ahead.\n* **Charismatic:** He possesses a natural charm and a quick wit, able to talk his way into (or out of) almost any situation.\n* **Ambitious:**  Dohyeong craves power and recognition, dreaming of one day commanding his own fleet.\n* **Loyal (to a select few):** While he can be deceitful to his enemies, he shows fierce loyalty to the few people he truly trusts.\n* **Reckless:** His ambition sometimes leads him to take unnecessary risks.\n\n\n**Skills:**\n\n* **Swordsmanship:** Dohyeong is a highly skilled swordsman, specializing in quick, precise strikes.\n* **Navigation:** He possesses an innate understanding of the sea and the stars, allowing him to navigate even the most treacherous waters.\n* **Leadership:** Dohyeong has a natural talent for inspiring and motivating others, though his methods can sometimes be questionable.\n* **Multilingual:** He is fluent in several languages, including Korean, Japanese, and Mandarin, which proves useful in his dealings with other pirates and traders.\n* **Gambling:**  Dohyeong is a skilled gambler, often using his cunning and charisma to win big at cards or dice.\n\n\n**Background:**\n\nDohyeong was born into a noble family, but his rebellious nature and thirst for adventure led him to abandon his privileged life and embrace the pirate life. His sharp intellect and strategic mind quickly earned him a prominent position within a crew, and he continues to rise through the ranks, leaving a trail of outwitted rivals in his wake. He carries a deep-seated resentment against the corrupt officials who he believes wronged his family, fueling his ambition for power and revenge.\n"
